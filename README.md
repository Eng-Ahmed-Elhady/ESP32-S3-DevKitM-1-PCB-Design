# 🚀 ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 — Complete Hardware Design Project

I’m proud to share my **complete ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 hardware design project!**  

As a **hardware and PCB design engineer**, I recently completed a full end-to-end development of a **custom ESP32-based board** — starting entirely from scratch and ending with the generation of **Gerber files** ready for manufacturing.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project represents a complete hardware design cycle — from component library creation to final fabrication.  
It was built entirely in **Altium Designer®**, following **JLCPCB** fabrication standards and **LCSC** component availability.

## ⚙️ Design Process

This journey covered every major stage of professional hardware development:

- **Library creation:**  
  Developed schematic symbols, footprints, and 3D models with proper parameter linking (LCSC, Digi-Key).

- **Schematic design:**  
  Integrated the ESP32-S3, FTDI USB–UART bridge, voltage regulation, USB interface, and all peripheral components.

- **Stack-up design:**  
  Implemented a 4-layer configuration (**Signal – Power – GND – Signal**) optimized for impedance control and EMI reduction.

- **High-speed layout:**  
  Routed **USB 2.0 differential pairs (90 Ω)** with controlled impedance, length matching, and via stitching for signal integrity.

- **Design verification:**  
  Performed **DRC** and **high-speed rule checks** aligned with **JLCPCB manufacturing capabilities**.

- **Fabrication & assembly:**  
  Generated Gerber, drill, and pick-and-place files, fabricated through **JLCPCB**, and successfully assembled.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills

This project was part of an **8-hour practical course** by **Robert Feranec**, where I learned and applied advanced techniques in:

- **Altium Designer® workflows:** rules setup, polygon management, via stitching, and pullback distance.  
- **Signal integrity & high-speed routing:** practical methods for EMI control and impedance matching.  
- **Professional documentation:** best practices for fabrication and assembly file preparation.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Component library creation (symbol, footprint, 3D model)  
- Impedance control and high-speed USB routing  
- Power integrity and decoupling design  
- DFM/DFT validation and real-world manufacturing alignment
